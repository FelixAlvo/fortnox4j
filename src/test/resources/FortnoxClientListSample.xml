    	FortnoxApiClients are the integration API clients, meaning the agent that
    	accesses a specific Fortnox client in order to read/write data to Fortnox
    	clients.
    	An API client has an ID and a corresponding clientSecret. This secret is the
    	secret of the actual API integration. The secret is combined with the specific
    	accessToken of a specific Fortnox client to gain access to that Fortnox client.
    	
    	There can be many ApiClients with different purposes and access rights. This is
    	why it's a list.

			However, currently, the organization number is used as a key to lookup
			clientInfo records, so currently it must be provided in this record.

            	since the clientSecret is derived using the entry in 
            	FortnoxApiClient.
            	ClientSecret can also be supplied in this record, thus
            	removing the need to have it separately in a FortnoxApiClient record.
